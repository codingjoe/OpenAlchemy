    Check whether a foreign key has already been defined.

    Assume model_schema has already resolved any $ref and allOf at the object level.
    They may not have been resolved at the property level.

    Check whether the proposed logical name is already defined on the model schema. If
    it has been, check that the type is correct and that the foreign key reference has
    been defined and points to the correct column.

    Raise MalformedRelationshipError if a property has already been defined with the
    same name as is proposed for the foreign key but it has the wrong type or does not
    define the correct foreign key constraint.

    Args:
        artifacts: The artifacts for constructing the object reference.
        fk_logical_name: The proposed name for the foreign key property.
        model_schema: The schema for the model on which the foreign key is proposed to
            be added.
        schemas: Used to resolve any $ref at the property level.

    Returns:
        Whether defining the foreign key is necessary given the model schema.
